Demand planners in the industry use commonly tools such as Microsoft Excel to forecast. Although Excel has many strengths and is a flexible tool, it is not well-suited whenever dealing with large amounts of time series. Demand planners struggle reviewing and manually adjusting those forecasts. As a result, they rely on aggregate level adjustments. In many cases, the aggregation is prone to mistakes and poorly reflects the underlying statistical process. Data Science can mitigate this process and make the prediction more precise. 
Usually, the demand forecasting setting is to estimate q(t,i) − the needed amount of a particular item i by the end of month t. For many supply chain problems, the definition is extended to estimate q(t,i,f) − the total quantity to be delivered by the end of month t through orders made f months in advance. Moreover, item i exists in a hierarchical relation and can have sibling items s, children items c and/or parent item p. Thus, adding an additional layer of complexity in forecasting its demand, as often it will depend on its hierarchical relation.
